LaForêt (a fictional company) faces new challenges due to evolving cyber risks. Despite the increased visibility of cybersecurity incidents, most organizations, including LaForêt, continue to view the cost of security as a necessary evil rather than an investment.

As a consultant, you have undertaken to present to LaForêt a cyber risk assessment
to which the cooperative is exposed. Your analysis must make it possible to better explain the risks to the executive, and make better decisions to protect the organization.

More precisely, your mission has two essential aspects: firstly, to carry out an in-depth analysis of one of the four types of cyber risk listed below and then propose a response and treatment strategy for said cyber risk.

## Framework 
Throughout our analysis, we had to stick to one of the following four types of cyber risk:
1. Breach of the confidentiality of the organization’s and its customers’ data
2. Attack on the availability and integrity of the organization’s operational systems
3. Impairment of the availability of data of the organization and its customers
4. Violation of the integrity of the organization’s and its customers’ data

Our team had decided to go with type 1. We then had to decide on a framework and methodoly to proceed with the risk analysis, and we went with [OCTAVE Allegro](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-octave-allegro-lazarus-alliance).
