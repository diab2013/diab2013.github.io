Throughout the years, cloud infrastructures have been taking a bigger role and importance with companies favoring and promoting the usage of the cloud instead of on-premise infrastructures. This has pushed for a higher need for better services and management of cloud infrastructures, without forgetting the security aspects of having an your whole organization relying on a setup accessible by public internet (public cloud). 

With this massive move to the cloud, multiple researches have been made to critic multiple aspects of using the cloud, and in comparative critic we will compare three scientific papers which all have the same general topic : security or cybersecurity in a cloud environment. Two of them focus on Amazon Cloud Services (AWS) and the third one  being more generic (sources are in the full critique). 

The importance of such comparative critic is crucial, because it brings a person to develop their critical thinking, understand research methodology, validating scientific claims while also identifying weaknesses and strengths in specific papers.
