Cloud computing represents a field currently in great expansion which includes many challenges, especially in terms of security. In fact, many companies use cloud computing as a tool to store their data. Or more of these data include sensitive or important information that needs to be kept away from malicious users. 

However, this environment remains at risk of attacks such as service and account hijacking attacks. So in this article, we seek to determine whether the AWS security recommendations can provide some basic level of protection against hijacking attacks on municipal services and accounts. 

Thus we carried out six service and account hijacking attacks out of two AWS environments are one non-compliant and one compliant in order to compare the impact of its attacks on each of them. For the non-compliant environment, it was possible to carry out all six attacks without difficulty while for the compliant environment none of the six attacks worked. 

This demonstrates that the AWS recommendations truly provide a good basis for creating a secure cloud computing environment and the importance of following these recommendations.

## Problem description
The objective of this project is to study and determine the impact of service and account hijacking on an AWS cloud environment. To do this, we will carry out different common attacks on an environment which will be based on AWS best practices and recommendations. 

Ultimately, this experiment will allow us to determine whether these recommendations can provide an adequate level of protection to an AWS infrastructure.
